You need to first install forever separately for auto reloading.
Process exit helps in restarting the server but only if forever is used.
YOu can tryu nodemon but it wont analyse the change in text file .
So auto reloading is not possible with that.
If application is started with node index then process.exit() has to be removed.
Since it exits the process.
